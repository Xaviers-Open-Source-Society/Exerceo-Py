Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:

    1634 = pow(1,4) + pow(6,4) + pow(3,4) + pow(4,4)
    8208 = pow(8,4) + pow(2,4) + pow(0,4) + pow(8,4)
    9474 = pow(9,4) + pow(4,4) + pow(7,4) + pow(4,4)

As 1 = pow(1,4) is not a sum it is not included.
The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.
Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.
Solution: 443839
